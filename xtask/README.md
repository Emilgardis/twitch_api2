----------------------------

Should: 

- [ ] Generate a website for easier access to endpoints/apis provided by this crate
- [ ] Improve CI actions, scripting in yml is hard.
- [ ] Some QOL utilities for generating code templates when new stuff lands.

Maybe:

- [ ] Fetch additions or changes to twitch documentation to catch changes in endpoints compared to root
- [ ] Some codegen for stuff that might benefit from it, e.g auto generating documentation.
